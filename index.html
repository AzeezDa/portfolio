        <p>I am a Computer Science Engineering Student at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kth.se">KTH Royal Institue of Technology</a> in Stockholm. I enjoy problem-solving, programming, mathematics and music.</p>

        <p>In my free time I usually work on fun programming projects which I upload to my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AzeezDa">GitHub</a>. I also like to play video games, read books and play music (mostly experimenting with digital synths).</p>

                <h4><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AzeezDa/eqsolver">Eqsolver</a></h4>
                <p><em>A Numerical Equation Solver Library for Rust.</em> This library includes solvers for non-linear system of equations using e.g. Newton-Raphson's method and Gauss-Newton's algorithm. It also includes a solver for systems of ordinary differential equations.</p>

                <p><em>A C++ simulation of Newton's Law of Gravitation.</em> This simulator uses SFML to visualise the motion of objects in space. The objects in the simulation can be described via a Lua Script which is passed into the simulator. Here is a <a target = "_blank", href="https://youtu.be/z1mdG82C3kY">video</a> on my YouTube channel that shows the results.</p>

                <p><em>A Rust simulation of Disease Spread with a Python-based interface.</em> This is a command-line interfaced program that takes a file of parameters and simulates a disease spread based on those parameters then outputs the result as a .csv file, a figure or both.</p>

                <p><em>An assembly language and emulator for a small computer.</em> The computer has 4-bit instructions, 8-bit registers and 12-bit addressing. The assembler is written in Haskell, the emulator is written in Rust and both the assembler and the emulator are interfaced with a Python script.</p>

                <p><em>A Computational Tree Logic (CTL) Semantic Verifier.</em> This is a library that provides the ability to define CTL models and verify the validity of formulas on these models. Most of the verification algorithms use modified version of a Breadth-First Search on graphs.</p>

                <p><em>A game built on an Uno32 w/ Basic I/O Shield.</em> This was a project of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/IS1500"> IS1500 Computer Organization and Components</a> course at KTH Royal Insitute of Technology. This project was made together with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Herdi2">Herdi2</a>.</p>

                <p><em>A Python-based GUI application built with Qt5, Plotly and Pandas to visualize CSV files.</em> I built this application after a request for a tool that helps visualize data in CSV files. It allows the user to query data and plot it as pie, line or bar charts with different customizations.</p>
