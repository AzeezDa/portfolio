        <p>I am a Computer Science Engineering Student at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kth.se">KTH Royal
                Institute of Technology</a> in Stockholm. I enjoy problem-solving, programming, mathematics and music.
        </p>

        <p>In my free time I usually work on fun programming projects which I upload to my <a target="_blank"
                href="https://github.com/AzeezDa">GitHub</a>. I also like to play video games, read books and play music
            (mostly experimenting with digital synths).</p>

                <p><em>A Numerical Equation Solver Library for Rust.</em> This library includes solvers for non-linear
                    system of equations using e.g. Newton-Raphson's method and Gauss-Newton's algorithm. It also
                    includes a solver for systems of ordinary differential equations.</p>

                <p><em>A C++ simulation of Newton's Law of Gravitation.</em> This simulator uses SFML to visualise the
                    motion of objects in space. The objects in the simulation can be described via a Lua Script which is
                    passed into the simulator. Here is a <a target="_blank" ,
                        href="https://youtu.be/z1mdG82C3kY">video</a> on my YouTube channel that shows the results.</p>

                <p><em>A Rust simulation of Disease Spread with a Python-based interface.</em> This is a command-line
                    interfaced program that takes a file of parameters and simulates a disease spread based on those
                    parameters then outputs the result as a .csv file, a figure or both.</p>

                <p><em>An assembly language and emulator for a small computer.</em> The computer has 4-bit instructions,
                    8-bit registers and 12-bit addressing. The assembler is written in Haskell, the emulator is written
                    in Rust and both the assembler and the emulator are interfaced with a Python script.</p>

                <p><em>A Computational Tree Logic (CTL) Semantic Verifier.</em> This is a library that provides the
                    ability to define CTL models and verify the validity of formulas on these models. Most of the
                    verification algorithms use modified version of a Breadth-First Search on graphs.</p>

                <p><em>A text generator based on higher-order Markov chains.</em> This is a C++ terminal tool that can
                    construct a higher-order Markov chain then generate text based on it. The constructed chain is saved
                    on disk, making the text generation very fast.</p>

                    built this application after a request for a tool that helps visualise data in CSV files. It allows
                    the user to query data and plot it as pie, line or bar charts with different customisations.</p>
